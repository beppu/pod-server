  The Ruby people have this nice utility called 
  
    gem_server 

  which is a little web server
  that serves up the documentation
  for all the locally installed rubygems.

  It's really handy.

  And then I was left wondering,
  "Why doesn't Perl have something like this???"
  It's only been 20 fucking years.
