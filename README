  The Ruby people have this nice utility called 
  
    gem_server 

  which is a little web server
  that serves up the documentation
  for all the locally installed rubygems.

  It's really handy.

  And then I was left wondering,
  "Why doesn't Perl have something like this???"

    (Apparently, it did...  There's something called Pod::WebServer
     which is a lot like Pod::Server, but I didn't know of its
     existence until after I wrote Pod::Server.)

  Pod::Server is better looking, though.  ;-)
  So try it out.


    pod_server --help
